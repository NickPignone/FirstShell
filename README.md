# FirstShell
Repository containing a program I created that is a personalized terminal shell that I wrote in the c language type. It allows for the user to cd to any directory, umask any directory, and also exit whenever the user wishes. In addition to those built in commands, the user can also run any other built-in commands their shell contains.
